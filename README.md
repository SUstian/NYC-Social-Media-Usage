# NYC-Social-Media-Usage

This dataset includes social media statistics - including likes, follows, visits, and app downloads - from various NYC agencies and organizations. The analysis utilizes Pandas and SQL to determine which platforms (i.e. social media, app downloads, video, etc.) have the most and least engagement.

From this analysis, it is clear that in 2011 and 2012, people were not engaging with NYC government agencies via video. Instead, they clearly preferred newsletter subscriptions and social media accounts.
